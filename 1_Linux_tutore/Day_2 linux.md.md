### LINUX
**linux**- is a kernel: meets sw and Hw and allocate some resources.
       -code or program.

#### HISTORY
- first 1969- **Unix** on *PDP-7* by **Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie**. 
But, not chip and not open source.
- **Linus Torvalds**: *linux* and make it *open-source* to his github online. written by **C** programming language.
- **Richard Stallman**: *GNU* project and *free software foundation*.  **GNU**: free  sw replacement to unix os. but it's sw replacement but not full os. eg {BASH, TAR, EMACS... }. 
    so,  GNU + linux => GNU/linux os.
  NB.  **os = kernel + sw**   ...which is must.
- **GNU linux**- is os, but **linux** is kernel.

**GNU LINUX OS**: unix like os, source code copied, modified and redistributed.
**SHELL**: cmd line interpreter(cli), to communicate user with kernel with our language.(it's like delala ye kuankua). 
### Types Of Shell(many)
eg. SH, BASH, ZSH, FISH... they are dt in color, piping and command compilation.
To identify your shell "**echo $SHELL**".
**linux:** the shell is terminal.
**windows**: the shell is cmd, and also hase power shell for ms.
SH: geba yale(piping)
BASH: more coloring
ZSH: extended feature of BASH
FISH: beautiful. colorful, animated, user interactive

## OS - main software on computer
**unix and GNU lINUX as os**
*OS_contains* kernel, sw, file extention, windows manager, Desktop env't (GI, interacts with linux os)
**Desktop envt**: eg. *mate*, *gnome*(animated and beautiful. seems w11), KDE plasma(seems windows), and XFCE.
**NB**. speed of desktop is depends on:
animation, Highgraphics, Quality.
>Do you have a slow pc? ...use XFCE and MATE?
>Do you have a high pc? ...use KDE plash, gmone(females);
## windows manager
eg. "i3-windows-manager" for slow pcs. 
u can use kali keyboard with out mouth.
## why linux for hacking
*Fast* for slow and high computers
*most used* 47% of developers used linux based os.
*websites* 32%  linux powered.
*smartphones* 85%
*webservers* above one million ...96.3%
most hacking tools.
linux desktop os ..2.09% on market.
Today, there are over 600 active linux distros.
most secured.
## linux distributions(Distro)
Distros have similar function but dt in some features and some things to use.
modified linux kerner. type of os with dt:
- linux kerner ...modified
- packages(GNU) ...added
- Package manager ...like ms for windows(modified bc for linux there is dt package manager).
- Desktop UI ...modified desktop Env't.      eg, MATE -> GNOME
There are so many distros. for instances:
- Debians(kali linux, ubuntu, parrot)
- Arch(Guarda, Black arch)
- Fedora
- Red Hat
- Gento
- Android
for beginners use *Debians*, for hard(professionals) use *Arch*.
Which one best for Hackers:
- kali linux- has all tools.
- parrot- has two options(for Developers and for Hackers)- has all tools.
- Guarda   
- Black Arch       these the last two are hesitating and not for beginners 
- Ubuntu- setup tools specifically. has no all tools.
### kali linux
debian derived linux distribution. for digital forensics and penetration testing.
maintained and funded by offensive security.
- desktop envt: XFCE
- package: apt
- shell: ZSH
### parrot
for security, privacy and development.
- desktop envt: MATE
- package: apt
- shell: BASH
### Guarda
Arch linux distribution os.
- desktop envt: KED PLASMA
- package: pacman
- shell: FISH
#### Do windows have distros?
No, bc not have open source(not editable kerner code).
It just gives updated and some features.

### How to install ??
1, **main methode**- no other os
2, **Dual Boot**- two OSs in one
3, **Live Boot**- using USB(like flash)
4, **Cloud Terminal**- best for low performance pc. (www.webminal.org)
5, **Virtual Machine**- one host os with 2 additionals can run at the same time.
- Type1 Virtualization(Bare-metal Hypervision)
     -no need os host os. directly to hardware.
- Type2 Virtualization(Hosted Hypervision)
     -Top(main) OS is must. easier to personal or development env't
     using VirtualBox or VMware workstation.
6, **WSL V2** (windows subsystem for linux)
        -linux is like cmd and Power Shell.
        -it gives only terminal. like Cloud terminal
