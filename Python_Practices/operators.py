#1 Arithmetiic operators and assignment operators
a = 1
b = 3
d = b      #assign b on d
a += b    #addition assignment
c = b**a
print(a, "  ", c)

#2 Comparison operators
a = 3
b = 4
print(a>b)
print(a==b)
print(a>=b)
print(a!=b)

#3 Logical operators
a = 4
b = 2
print(a>b and a<b)
print(not a>b)
print(a>b or a<b)

#4 Bitwise operators
