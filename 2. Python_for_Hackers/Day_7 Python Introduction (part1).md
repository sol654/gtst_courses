# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

- **Algorithm**: used to understand algorithm of a program.
- **Pseudocode**: used to understand algorithm and program.
-**Eg**. A pseudocode for a system that can accept **Username** and **password**:
   *so/n.*
```
         BEGIN
             prompt user or username
             prompt user for password
             If `username` and password match
                DISPLAY "Login successfully!"
             else
                 DISPLAY "Login failed"
		END
```
-Eg2. pseudo code for calculator:
   *so/n*. 
```
         BEGIN
             DISPLAY 'Enter the first number:'
             Input number1
            `DISPLAY` 'Enter the second number:'
             Input number2
             Result = number1 + number2
             DISPLAY "Result:", Result
         END
```
### Evaluation of I/O(Input or Output)
1. Paper(**punch cards with all data**) and output was to a **line printer**.
2. **Interactive processing**: in a **question and answer format**.
                    - providing a data while the program was running.
### Generations of computer
**1st-generation**: **vaccume tube** -> punch cards
**2nd-generation**: **Transisters** -> interactive processing, programming started(with **Assembly**).
**3rd-generation**: **Integrated-cercuite** -> one board with many transistors.
                              eg.   Basic, Cobol, Fortran, Pascal, C, C++, perl, Ada
**4th-generation**: micro-controller -> billions transistors with one micro-controller.
                            eg.   Python, Mathlab, SQL
**5th-generation**: AI -> quantum.
### Types of programming language
- If you closes to machine language(fast), but become like human language (slower).
**A**. **Low-level programming language**: Assebly, C ...
**B**. **High-level programming language**: Java, c++, python...
1. **Compiler**: convert the whole code to bytecode then the computer excutes.  eg. java, c++..
    eg.  source code(Hello.java) -----------> bytecode(hello.class) ----------> output
                         *compile*                                          *excute*
2. **Interpreter**: runs line by line.  eg.  Python 
      eg.  source code(hello.py) ----------> excute(output)
# Python programming

- **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment): software that runs only one language.
         eg. PythonIDE
 - **Code Editors**: runs any kind of programming language.
          eg. Sublime, VScode
  **Python**: developed by **Guido Van Rossum**
       (with Computer science and mathematics team in Netherland).
   - python is derived from many other languages. include:
      ABC, Modula-3, c, c++, Algol-68, SmallTalk and UnixShell & other scripting languages.
#### How can install or use a python?
1. Install python from: `www.python.org`
2. Also, Install python extensions of VScode and then use it.(the extension is: *python*)
**or**
- To Install Python in Linux: `sudo apt install python3`
- Then, To write a python code using terminal use the command: `python3`
     then you can write the code.
